				Active participation makes the session so much fun and gives me and your peers much more energy. We are
				all sitting in our offices with little sound. Your voices and perspectives enlivens the session. We encourage
				you to engage with each other and instructors.

				The participants window lists everyone in the session and click the icons at the bottom to communicate with
				the instructors.

				You can also use the Chat windows to comment or ask questions at any time. It is also a good place to share
				problems with your audio connection.

			<aside class="notes">
			<p>
				This workshops is eligible for the Canadian Certificate in Digital Humanities https://ccdhhn.ca/. This is a program that allows you to claim non-credit workshops and training towards a certificate. If you are interested in claiming this workshop please fill out this form: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cwiqRxedypNPhA2. This is how we track attendance for the purposes of the certificate, it will only be shared during the workshop and will not be emailed to you after."

Note that they have to click on the form during the workshop, we will not share it after. If you could encourage anyone who's interested to take a few minutes and fill it out at the end of the workshop that would be great.

					For hands-on exercises, we will use [Python](https://www.python.org/) on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). You don’t need to have Python installed. Please make sure that you have a [UBC Syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) or a [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) account. (You will need a CWL login to access Syzygy.)

					hands-on exercises, programming tools and libraries, such as [Python] and [scikit-learn] prior familiarity with Python programming is recommended, we do not study the codes in detail

					Input Layer: Receives data. Like our senses perceive the environment.
					Hidden Layers: Process data. The 'thinking' happens here. Depth Over Width: Hidden layers allow neural networks to be "deep", giving depth to the learning process.
					Feature Transformation: Hidden layers help transform inputs in a way that makes them separable by the time they reach the output layer.
					Capturing Complexities: The more hidden layers and neurons, the more complexities a network can capture. However, this also increases the risk of overfitting.
					Output Layer: Provides the result.

			<h3> Why use Neural Networks over simple ML models?</h3>

			<p> Source: Stack Exchange </p>
			<aside class="notes">
				<p>
					Linear Limitations: Simple ML models like linear regression often assume a linear relationship between inputs and outputs. They might not capture complex patterns well.
					High Dimensionality: Neural networks can handle data with many features more effectively.
					Complex Decision Boundaries: Neural networks can model non-linear and intricate relationships in data, making them more versatile for varied tasks.</p>

			<h3> Some other reasons to use Neural Networks</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Versatility: Can be applied to a wide variety of tasks. </li>
				<li> Learning Capability: Can improve over time with more data.</li>
				<li> Complex Decision Boundaries: Can model non-linear and complex relationships in data.</li>
			</ul>
			<aside class="notes">
				<p>
					Weights & Biases: These determine the strength and direction of the signal between neurons. Adjusted during learning.
					Activation Function: Determines if a neuron should be activated or not.

				Forward Propagation: Input data is passed through for an output.
				Loss Calculation: Difference between predicted and actual output.
				Backpropagation: Adjusting weights and biases.
